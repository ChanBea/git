.. glossary::

    AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
        A specification for the encryption of electronic data established by National Institute of Standards
        and Technology. A variant of the Rijndael block cipher.

    CRL (Certificate Revocation List)
        A method of preventing the validation of unwanted certificates by containing the identities of certificates
        that are deeemed unworthy.

    CSR (Certificate Signing Request)
        A message sent from an applicant to a certificate authority of the public key infrastructure in order to
        apply for a digital identity certificate.

    DES (Data Encryption Standard)
        A symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data.

    DSA certificate
        An SSL certificate that uses the DSA(Digital Signature Algorithm) algorithm for digital signatures
        and/or data encryption.

    ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)
        Promises stronger security and increased performance in shorter key lengths.

    ECDSA
        An SSL certificate that uses the ECDSA (Ellptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) algorithm
        for digital signatures and/or data encryption.

    EdDSA
        An SSL certificate that uses the ECDSA (Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) algorithm
        for digital signatures and/or data encryption.

    OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)
        An Internet Protocol that certificate authorities use to determine the status of secure sockets layer/trasport
        layer security certificates.

    OpenSSL
        A cryptographic toolkit that consists of many different utilities.

    PKCS (Public Key Cryptography Standards)
        A group of public key cryptography standards devised and published by RSA Security LLC.

    PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
       A set of roles, policies, hardware, software and procdures needed to create, use, manage, distribute,
       and store digital certificates.

    Root Certificate
        A public key cerificate that identifies a root certificate authority.

    RSA certificate
        An SSL certificate that uses the RSA(Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm for digital signatures
        and/or data encryption.

    SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
        A security protocol that creates an encrypted link between a web server and a web browser.

    SAN (Subject Alternative Name)
        A structured way to indicate all the domain names and IP addresses that are secured by the certificate.

    TLS (Transport Layer Security)
        A protocol or communication rule that allows computer systems to talk to each other on the internet safely.
