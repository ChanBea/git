<!--
Thank you for your report.  

Investigation reports are meant to codify larger issues in openssl for which
thre is no immediate corrective action known or recognized.  Instead, these
issues are meant to allow a space for developers to discuss problems in the
project that may span a wide range of topics, which may result in future
specific actions to be taken.  If such actions are identified, new bug report
issues should be created with specific problems and corrective tasks identified,
which should then be linked here.  Investigation issues will themselves not be
scheduled to be addressed.
