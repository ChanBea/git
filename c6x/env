# This file is meant to perform environment/target-specific setup steps.
# Normally it's just a bunch of environment variables. For this reason
# it's customarily "sourced" into current shell environment, e.g.
# '. c6x/env'. Exactly which variables and their values naturally vary
# depending on specifics, but at the very least one is likely to adjust
# PATH so that compiler can be invoked simply by 'cl6x'. Then C6X_C_DIR
# is likely to be required. For CCSv3-specific c6x/run6x to work one has
# to set PERL5LIB to point at directory where CCS_SCRIPTING_PERL module
# resides. While for c6x/run6x.js, command-line program launcher for more
# recent CCS versions, one has to set CCSTARGETCONFIG to point at relevant
# Target Configuration file, as well as to ensure that 'dss.sh' is on PATH.
# If target is not C64x+, then one has to set C6XPLATFORM and C6XSILICON,
# e.g. to 'c64x' and '6400' respectively. And while we are at the subject
# of customizations, user is also expected to provide c6x/fips_algvs.cmd
# file that describes target system's memory layout and suitable linker
# options.
