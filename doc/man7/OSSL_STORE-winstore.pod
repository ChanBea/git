=head1 NAME

OSSL_STORE-winstore - OpenSSL built in OSSL_STORE for Windows

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The OSSL_STORE implementation for Windows provides access to Windows' system
C<ROOT> certificate store through URIs, using the URI scheme
C<org.openssl.winstore>.

=head2 Supported URIs

There is only one supported URI:

  org.openssl.winstore:

No authority (host, etc), no path, no query, no fragment.

=head2 Supported OSSL_STORE_SEARCH operations

=over 4

=item L<OSSL_STORE_SEARCH_by_name(3)>

As a matter of fact, this must be used.  It is not possible to enumerate all
available certificates in the store.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<ossl_store(7)>, L<OSSL_STORE_open_ex(3)>, L<OSSL_STORE_SEARCH(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

The winstore (C<org.openssl.winstore>) implementation was added in OpenSSL
3.2.0.

=head1 NOTES

This implementation uses L<OSSL_DECODER(3)> implementations under the hood.
To influence what implementations are used, it's advisable to use
L<OSSL_STORE_open_ex(3)> and set the I<propq> argument.
