=head1 NAME

openssl/core_names.h - OpenSSL provider parameter names

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/core_names.h>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<< <openssl/core_names.h> >> header defines a multitude of macros
for L<OSSL_PARAM(3)> names, algorithm names and other known names used
with OpenSSL's providers, made available for practical purposes only.

Existing names are further described in the manuals for OpenSSL's
providers (see L</SEE ALSO>) and the manuals for each algorithm they
provide (listed in those provider manuals).

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<OSSL_PROVIDER-default(7)>, L<OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS(7)>

=head1 HISTORY

The macros described here were added in OpenSSL 3.0.

=head1 CAVEATS

=begin comment

CAVEATS is a section name borrowed from OpenBSD, where mdoc(7)
explains it like this:

    CAVEATS
    Common misuses and misunderstandings should be explained in this
    section.

=end comment

I<This header file does not constitute a general registry of names>.
Providers that implement new algorithms are to be responsible for
their own parameter names.

However, authors of provider that implement their own variants of
algorithms that OpenSSL providers support will want to pay attention
to the names provided in this header to work in a compatible manner.
