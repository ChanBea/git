=head1 NAME

EVP_RAND-CRNG-TEST - The FIPS health testing EVP_RAND filter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for the L<SP 800-90B|https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/90/b/final>
section 4 health tests as a filter between the entropy source and its
users.  This EVP_RAND forwards most requests to the entropy source,
either via its parent reference or via the provider entropy upcalls.

=head2 Identity

"CRNG-TEST" is the name for this implementation; it can be used with the
EVP_RAND_fetch() function.

=head2 Supported parameters

There are no supported parameters, rather the request is forwarded to
the parent seed source for processing.

=head1 NOTES

This EVP_RAND is only implemented by the FIPS provider.

A context for a health test filter can be obtained by calling:

 EVP_RAND *parent = ...;
 EVP_RAND *rand = EVP_RAND_fetch(NULL, "CRNG-TEST", NULL);
 EVP_RAND_CTX *rctx = EVP_RAND_CTX_new(rand, parent);
