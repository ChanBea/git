=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <opentls/serializer.h>

 typedef struct otls_serializer_ctx_st Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX;

 Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX *Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX_new(Otls_SERIALIZER *ser);
 const Otls_SERIALIZER *
 Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX_get_serializer(Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX *ctx);
 const Otls_PARAM *Otls_SERIALIZER_settable_ctx_params(Otls_SERIALIZER *ser);
 int Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX_set_params(Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX *ctx,
                                    const Otls_PARAM params[]);
 void Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX_free(Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX *ctx);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX> is a context with which B<Otls_SERIALIZER>
operations are performed.  The context typically holds values, both
internal and supplied by the application, which are useful for the
implementations supplied by providers.

Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX_new() creates a B<Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX> associated
with the serializer I<ser>.  NULL is a valid I<ser>, the context will
be created anyway, it's just not very useful.  This is intentional, to
distinguish between errors in allocating the context or assigning it
values on one hand, and the lack of serializer support on the other.

=begin comment

The above distinction makes it possible for other routines to sense if
they need to report an error or fall back on other methods to
serialize.

=end comment

Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX_get_serializer() gets the serializer method
currently associated with the context I<ctx>.

Otls_SERIALIZER_settable_ctx_params() returns an L<Otls_PARAM(3)>
array of parameter descriptors.

Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX_set_params() attempts to set parameters specified
with an L<Otls_PARAM(3)> array I<params>.  Parameters that the
implementation doesn't recognise should be ignored.

Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX_free() frees the given context I<ctx>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX_new() returns a pointer to a
B<Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX>, or NULL if the context structure couldn't be
allocated.

Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX_get_serializer() returns a pointer to the
serializer method associated with I<ctx>.  NULL is a valid return
value and signifies that there is no associated serializer method.

Otls_SERIALIZER_settable_ctx_params() returns an L<Otls_PARAM(3)>
array, or NULL if none is available.

Otls_SERIALIZER_CTX_set_params() returns 1 if all recognised
parameters were valid, or 0 if one of them was invalid or caused some
other failure in the implementation.
