=head1 NAME

EVP_rc4,
EVP_rc4_40,
EVP_rc4_hmac_md5
- EVP RC4 stream cipher

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for comment generic

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_ciphername(void)

I<EVP_ciphername> is used a placeholder for any of the described cipher
functions, such as I<EVP_rc4>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The RC4 stream cipher for EVP.

=over 4

=item EVP_rc4()

RC4 stream cipher. This is a variable key length cipher with a default key
length of 128 bits.

=item EVP_rc4_40()

RC4 stream cipher with 40 bit key length. This is obsolete and new code should
use EVP_rc4() and the EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_key_length() function.

=item EVP_rc4_hmac_md5()

Authenticated encryption with the RC4 stream cipher with MD5 as HMAC.

=back

=head1 RETURN VALUES

These functions return a B<EVP_CIPHER> structure that contains the
implementation of the symmetric cipher. See L<EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3)> for
details of the B<EVP_CIPHER> structure.
