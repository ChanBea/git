=head1 NAME

OPENtls_Applink - glue between Opentls BIO and Win32 compiler run-time

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 __declspec(dllexport) void **OPENtls_Applink();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OPENtls_Applink is application-side interface which provides a glue
between Opentls BIO layer and Win32 compiler run-time environment.
Even though it appears at application side, it's essentially Opentls
private interface. For this reason application developers are not
expected to implement it, but to compile provided module with
compiler of their choice and link it into the target application.
The referred module is available as F<applink.c>, located alongside
the public header files (only on the platforms where applicable).

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Not available.
