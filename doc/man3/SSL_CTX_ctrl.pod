=head1 NAME

tls_CTX_ctrl, tls_CTX_callback_ctrl, tls_ctrl, tls_callback_ctrl - internal handling functions for tls_CTX and tls objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <opentls/tls.h>

 long tls_CTX_ctrl(tls_CTX *ctx, int cmd, long larg, void *parg);
 long tls_CTX_callback_ctrl(tls_CTX *, int cmd, void (*fp)());

 long tls_ctrl(tls *tls, int cmd, long larg, void *parg);
 long tls_callback_ctrl(tls *, int cmd, void (*fp)());

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The tls_*_ctrl() family of functions is used to manipulate settings of
the tls_CTX and tls objects. Depending on the command B<cmd> the arguments
B<larg>, B<parg>, or B<fp> are evaluated. These functions should never
be called directly. All functionalities needed are made available via
other functions or macros.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The return values of the tls*_ctrl() functions depend on the command
supplied via the B<cmd> parameter.
