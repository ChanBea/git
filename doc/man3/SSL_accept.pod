=head1 NAME

tls_accept - wait for a TLS/tls client to initiate a TLS/tls handshake

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <opentls/tls.h>

 int tls_accept(tls *tls);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

tls_accept() waits for a TLS/tls client to initiate the TLS/tls handshake.
The communication channel must already have been set and assigned to the
B<tls> by setting an underlying B<BIO>.

=head1 NOTES

The behaviour of tls_accept() depends on the underlying BIO.

If the underlying BIO is B<blocking>, tls_accept() will only return once the
handshake has been finished or an error occurred.

If the underlying BIO is B<non-blocking>, tls_accept() will also return
when the underlying BIO could not satisfy the needs of tls_accept()
to continue the handshake, indicating the problem by the return value -1.
In this case a call to tls_get_error() with the
return value of tls_accept() will yield B<tls_ERROR_WANT_READ> or
B<tls_ERROR_WANT_WRITE>. The calling process then must repeat the call after
taking appropriate action to satisfy the needs of tls_accept().
The action depends on the underlying BIO. When using a non-blocking socket,
nothing is to be done, but select() can be used to check for the required
condition. When using a buffering BIO, like a BIO pair, data must be written
into or retrieved out of the BIO before being able to continue.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The following return values can occur:

=over 4

=item Z<>0

The TLS/tls handshake was not successful but was shut down controlled and
by the specifications of the TLS/tls protocol. Call tls_get_error() with the
return value B<ret> to find out the reason.

=item Z<>1

The TLS/tls handshake was successfully completed, a TLS/tls connection has been
established.

=item E<lt>0

The TLS/tls handshake was not successful because a fatal error occurred either
at the protocol level or a connection failure occurred. The shutdown was
not clean. It can also occur of action is need to continue the operation
for non-blocking BIOs. Call tls_get_error() with the return value B<ret>
to find out the reason.
