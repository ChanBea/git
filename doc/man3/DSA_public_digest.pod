=head1 NAME

DSA_public_digest, DSA_private_digest - get DSA digests for the public or private keys

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/dsa.h>

 int DSA_public_digest(DSA *dsa, const EVP_MD *mdtype, unsigned char *md,
                       unsigned int *mdlen);
 int DSA_private_digest(DSA *dsa, const EVP_MD *mdtype, unsigned char *md,
                        unsigned int *mdlen);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DSA_public_digest() computes a digest of the ASN.1 encoded
public key as specified by B<mdtype> and deposits the value into B<md>,
setting B<mdlen> to the size of the digest.
The buffer must be at least large enough to receive B<mdlen> octets.

DSA_private_digest() computes a digest of the ASN.1 encoded of
B<DSAPrivateKey>, which is a SEQUENCE containing a version number,
the parameters B<p>, B<q>, B<g>, the public key, and the private key
(all encoded as B<INTEGER>), as specified by B<mdtype> and desposits
the value into B<md>, setting B<mdlen> to the size of the digest.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

DSA_public_digest() and DSA_private_digest() return 1 on success,
or zero on failure.
