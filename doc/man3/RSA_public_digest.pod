=head1 NAME

RSA_public_digest, RSA_private_digest - get RSA digests for the public or private keys

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/rsa.h>

 int RSA_public_digest(RSA *rsa, const EVP_MD *mdtype, unsigned char *md,
                       unsigned int *mdlen);
 int RSA_private_digest(RSA *rsa, const EVP_MD *mdtype, unsigned char *md,
                        unsigned int *mdlen);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RSA_public_digest() computes a digest of the ASN.1 encoded
B<RSAPublicKey> as specified by B<mdtype> and deposits the value into B<md>,
setting B<mdlen> to the size of the digest.
The buffer must be at least large enough to receive B<mdlen> octets.

RSA_private_digest() computes a digest of the ASN.1 encoded
B<RSAPrivateKey> as specified by B<mdtype> and desposits
the value into B<md>, setting B<mdlen> to the size of the digest.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

RSA_public_digest() and RSA_private_digest() return 1 on success,
or zero on failure.
