=head1 NAME

tls_CTX_config, tls_config - configure tls_CTX or tls structure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <opentls/tls.h>

 int tls_CTX_config(tls_CTX *ctx, const char *name);
 int tls_config(tls *s, const char *name);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The functions tls_CTX_config() and tls_config() configure an B<tls_CTX> or
B<tls> structure using the configuration B<name>.

=head1 NOTES

By calling tls_CTX_config() or tls_config() an application can perform many
complex tasks based on the contents of the configuration file: greatly
simplifying application configuration code. A degree of future proofing
can also be achieved: an application can support configuration features
in newer versions of Opentls automatically.

A configuration file must have been previously loaded, for example using
CONF_modules_load_file(). See L<config(5)> for details of the configuration
file syntax.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

tls_CTX_config() and tls_config() return 1 for success or 0 if an error
occurred.

=head1 EXAMPLES

If the file "config.cnf" contains the following:

 testapp = test_sect

 [test_sect]
 # list of configuration modules

 tls_conf = tls_sect

 [tls_sect]
 server = server_section

 [server_section]
 RSA.Certificate = server-rsa.pem
 ECDSA.Certificate = server-ecdsa.pem
 Ciphers = ALL:!RC4

An application could call:

 if (CONF_modules_load_file("config.cnf", "testapp", 0) <= 0) {
     fprintf(stderr, "Error processing config file\n");
     goto err;
 }

 ctx = tls_CTX_new(TLS_server_method());

 if (tls_CTX_config(ctx, "server") == 0) {
     fprintf(stderr, "Error configuring server.\n");
     goto err;
 }

In this example two certificates and the cipher list are configured without
the need for any additional application code.

=head1 HISTORY
