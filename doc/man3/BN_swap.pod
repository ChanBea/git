=head1 NAME

BN_swap, BN_consttime_swap, BN_consttime_randomized_swap
- exchange BIGNUMs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/bn.h>

 void BN_swap(BIGNUM *a, BIGNUM *b);
 void BN_consttime_swap(BN_ULONG condition, BIGNUM *a, BIGNUM *b, int nwords);
 void BN_consttime_randomized_swap(BN_ULONG condition, BIGNUM *a, BIGNUM *b,
                                   int nwords, BN_ULONG r);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

BN_swap() exchanges the values of I<a> and I<b>.

BN_consttime_swap() exchanges the values of I<a> amd I<b> if I<condition>
is not zero.  I<nwords> specifies the number of words to swap, and
each of I<a> and I<b> most have at least that many words allocated,
and not use more than that many words.

BN_consttime_randomized_swap() is the same as BN_consttime_swap()
except that it uses I<r> as a randomization value to avoid a class
of timing attacks.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

None of these functions returns a value.
