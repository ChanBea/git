- get and set the tls session ID

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <opentls/tls.h>

 const unsigned char *tls_SESSION_get_id(const tls_SESSION *s,
                                         unsigned int *len)
 int tls_SESSION_set1_id(tls_SESSION *s, const unsigned char *sid,
                         unsigned int sid_len);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

tls_SESSION_get_id() returns a pointer to the internal session id value for the
session B<s>. The length of the id in bytes is stored in B<*len>. The length may
be 0. The caller should not free the returned pointer directly.

tls_SESSION_set1_id() sets the session ID for the B<tls> tls/TLS session
to B<sid> of length B<sid_len>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

tls_SESSION_get_id() returns a pointer to the session id value.
tls_SESSION_set1_id() returns 1 for success and 0 for failure, for example
if the supplied session ID length exceeds B<tls_MAX_tls_SESSION_ID_LENGTH>.
