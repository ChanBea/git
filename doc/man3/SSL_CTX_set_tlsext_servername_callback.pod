=head1 NAME

SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback, SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_arg,
SSL_get_servername_type, SSL_get_servername - handle server name indication
(SNI)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 long SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback(SSL_CTX *ctx,
                                   int (*cb)(SSL *, void *));

 long SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_arg(SSL_CTX *ctx, void *arg);

 long SSL_get_servername_type(SSL *s);
 long SSL_get_servername(SSL *s);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback() sets the application callback B<cb>
used by a server to perform any actions or configuration required based on
the servername extension received in the incoming connection. When B<cb>
is NULL, SNI is not used. The B<arg> value is a pointer which is passed to
the application callback.

SSL_get_servername() returns a pointer to the selected server name for the 
connection, SSL_get_servername_type() returns the type.

=head1 NOTES

The ALPN callback is executed after the servername callback; as that servername
callback may update the SSL_CTX, and subsequently, the ALPN callback.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_CTX_set_alpn_protos() and SSL_set_alpn_protos() return 0 on success, and
non-0 on failure. WARNING: these functions reverse the return value convention.
