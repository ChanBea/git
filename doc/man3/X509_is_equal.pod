=head1 NAME

X509_is_equal, X509_NAME_is_equal, X509_CRL_is_equal
- check if X509 certificates and CRLs are identical

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509.h>

 int X509_is_equal(const X509 *a, const X509 *b);
 int X509_NAME_is_equal(const X509_NAME *a, const X509_NAME *b);
 int X509_CRL_is_equal(const X509_CRL *a, const X509_CRL *b);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This set of functions are used to compare X509 objects, including X509
certificates and X509 CRL objects.

Unlike the L<X509_cmp(3)> and related APIs, these functions return an explicit
result indicating the two compared objects are identical or not.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

X509_is_equal(), X509_NAME_is_equal() and X509_CRL_is_equal() return B<1> if the
two compared objects are identical and return B<0> if not.

X509_NAME_is_equal() and X509_CRL_is_equal() may return B<-1> if an error occurs.

=head1 SEE ALSO
