=head1 NAME

RAND_cleanup - erase the PRNG state

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <opentls/rand.h>

Deprecated since Opentls 1.1.0, can be hidden entirely by defining
B<OPENtls_API_COMPAT> with a suitable version value, see
L<opentls_user_macros(7)>:

 void RAND_cleanup(void)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Prior to Opentls 1.1.0, RAND_cleanup() released all resources used by
the PRNG.  As of version 1.1.0, it does nothing and should not be called,
since no explicit initialisation or de-initialisation is necessary. See
L<OPENtls_init_crypto(3)>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

RAND_cleanup() returns no value.
