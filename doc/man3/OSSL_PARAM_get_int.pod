=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for comment generic

 #include <openssl/params.h>

 const OSSL_PARAM *OSSL_PARAM_locate(const OSSL_PARAM *p, const char *key);

 int OSSL_PARAM_get_TYPE(const OSSL_PARAM *p, const char *key, TYPE *val);

 int OSSL_PARAM_set_TYPE(const OSSL_PARAM *p, const char *key, TYPE val);

 int OSSL_PARAM_get_bignum(const OSSL_PARAM *p, const char *key, BIGNUM **val);

 int OSSL_PARAM_set_bignum(OSSL_PARAM *p, const char *key, const BIGNUM *val);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A collection of utility functions that simplify and add type safety to the
OSSL_PARAM arrays.  In the following text, B<TYPE> stands for one of the
following C types:

 int
 unsigned int
 int64_t
 uint64_t
 long
 unsigned long
 size_t
 double

OSSL_PARAM_locate() finds the parameter in the B<p> list with the name B<key>.

OSSL_PARAM_get_TYPE() retrieves a value of type B<TYPE> from the parameter
array B<p> using the B<key>.
The value is copied to the address B<val>.
No type coercion is done; it is an error if the type used for a get does
not match the type used during a set.

OSSL_PARAM_set_TYPE() stores a value B<val> of type B<TYPE> into the parameter
array B<p> using the B<key>.
Type coercion takes place as discussed in NOTES section.

OSSL_PARAM_set_bignum() stores the BIGNUM B<val> in the specified parameter
value. It also internally stores the size of the buffer used; this is why
the function does not take a constant B<p> value.

OSSL_PARAM_get_bignum() retrieves a BIGNUM from the parameter B<key> in the
array pointed to by B<p>.
The BIGNUM referenced by B<val> is updated and is allocated if B<*val> is
B<NULL>.  If also internally stores the serialized size of the number; if
the value of B<val> changes, this function must be called again.

OSSL_PARAM_set_bignum() stores the BIGNUM B<val> into the paramater array B<p> at
the position indicated by B<key>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

All of these functions return B<1> on success and B<0> on failure.
