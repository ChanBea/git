=head1 NAME

RAND_DRBG_get0_master,
RAND_DRBG_get0_public,
RAND_DRBG_get0_private
- get access to the global RAND_DRBG instances

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/rand_drbg.h>

 RAND_DRBG *RAND_DRBG_get0_master(void);
 RAND_DRBG *RAND_DRBG_get0_public(void);
 RAND_DRBG *RAND_DRBG_get0_private(void);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The default RAND API implementation (RAND_OpenSSL()) utilizes three
global DRBG instances which are accessed via RAND_bytes() and RAND_priv_bytes().
These functions here provide access to the global DRBG instances to allow for
configuring their parameters.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

RAND_DRBG_get0_master() returns a pointer to the master DRBG instance.

RAND_DRBG_get0_public() returns a pointer to the public DRBG instance.

RAND_DRBG_get0_private() returns a pointer to the private DRBG instance.


=head1 NOTES

It is not thread safe to access the global DRBG instances.
The settings of the global DRBG instances should only be changed during
application initialization, before creating additional threads.

During initialization, it is possible to change the reseed interval
and reseed time interval.
It is also possible to exchange the reseeding callbacks entirely.


=head1 HISTORY

The RAND_DRBG functions were added in OpenSSL 1.1.1.
