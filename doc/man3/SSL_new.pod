=head1 NAME

tls_dup, tls_new, tls_up_ref - create an tls structure for a connection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <opentls/tls.h>

 tls *tls_dup(tls *s);
 tls *tls_new(tls_CTX *ctx);
 int tls_up_ref(tls *s);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

tls_new() creates a new B<tls> structure which is needed to hold the
data for a TLS/tls connection. The new structure inherits the settings
of the underlying context B<ctx>: connection method,
options, verification settings, timeout settings. An B<tls> structure is
reference counted. Creating an B<tls> structure for the first time increments
the reference count. Freeing it (using tls_free) decrements it. When the
reference count drops to zero, any memory or resources allocated to the B<tls>
structure are freed.

tls_up_ref() increments the reference count for an
existing B<tls> structure.

tls_dup() duplicates an existing B<tls> structure into a new allocated one
or just increments the reference count if the connection is active. All
settings are inherited from the original B<tls> structure. Dynamic data (i.e.
existing connection details) are not copied, the new B<tls> is set into an
initial accept (server) or connect (client) state.

tls_dup() allows applications to configure an tls handle for use in multiple
tls connections, and then duplicate it prior to initiating each connection
with the duplicated handle.  Use of tls_dup() avoids the need to repeat
the configuration of the handles for each connection.

For tls_dup() to work, the connection MUST be in its initial state and
MUST NOT have not yet have started the tls handshake.  For connections
that are not in their initial state tls_dup() just increments an internal
reference count and returns the I<same> handle.  It may be possible to
use L<tls_clear(3)> to recycle an tls handle that is not in its initial
state for re-use, but this is best avoided.  Instead, save and restore
the session, if desired, and construct a fresh handle for each connection.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The following return values can occur:

=over 4

=item NULL

The creation of a new tls structure failed. Check the error stack to
find out the reason.

=item Pointer to an tls structure

The return value points to an allocated tls structure.

tls_up_ref() returns 1 for success and 0 for failure.
