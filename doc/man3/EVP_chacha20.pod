=head1 NAME

EVP_chacha20,
EVP_chacha20_poly1305
- EVP ChaCha20 stream cipher

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=for comment generic

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_ciphername(void)

I<EVP_ciphername> is used a placeholder for any of the described cipher
functions, such as I<EVP_chacha20>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ChaCha20 stream cipher for EVP.

=over 4

=item EVP_chacha20()

The ChaCha20 stream cipher. The key length is 256 bits, the IV is 96 bits long.

=item EVP_chacha20_poly1305()

Authenticated encryption with ChaCha20-Poly1305. Like EVP_chacha20(), the key
is 256 bits and the IV is 96 bits. This supports additional authenticated data
(AAD) and produces a 128-bit authentication tag. See the
L<EVP_EncryptInit(3)/AEAD Interface> section for more information.

=back

=head1 RETURN VALUES

These functions return a B<EVP_CIPHER> structure that contains the
implementation of the symmetric cipher. See L<EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3)> for
details of the B<EVP_CIPHER> structure.
