=head1 NAME

CMS_EnvelopedData_create - Create CMS envelope

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/cms.h>

CMS_ContentInfo *CMS_EnvelopedData_create(const EVP_CIPHER *cipher);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<CMS_ContentInfo>  

CMS_EnvelopedData_create() creates a B<CMS_ContentInfo> structure with
a type B<NID_pkcs7_enveloped>.

The recipients can be added afterwards and the CMS_final() needs to be called
to finalize the B<CMS_ContentInfo> structure.

=head1 NOTES

Although CMS_EnvelopedData_create() allocates a new B<CMS_ContentInfo>
structure it is usually not used in applications. The wrappers CMS_encrypt()
and CMS_decrypt() are often used instead.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

If the allocation fails, CMS_EnvelopedData_create() returns NULL and sets
an error code that can be obtained by L<ERR_get_error(3)>.
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.
