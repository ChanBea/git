=head1 NAME

tls_get_fd, tls_get_rfd, tls_get_wfd - get file descriptor linked to an tls object

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <opentls/tls.h>

 int tls_get_fd(const tls *tls);
 int tls_get_rfd(const tls *tls);
 int tls_get_wfd(const tls *tls);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

tls_get_fd() returns the file descriptor which is linked to B<tls>.
tls_get_rfd() and tls_get_wfd() return the file descriptors for the
read or the write channel, which can be different. If the read and the
write channel are different, tls_get_fd() will return the file descriptor
of the read channel.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The following return values can occur:

=over 4

=item -1

The operation failed, because the underlying BIO is not of the correct type
(suitable for file descriptors).

=item E<gt>=0

The file descriptor linked to B<tls>.
