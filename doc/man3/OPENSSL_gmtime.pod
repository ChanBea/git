=head1 NAME

OPENSSL_gmtime,
OPENSSL_gmtime_adj,
OPENSSL_gmtime_diff - platform-agnostic OpenSSL time routines

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/crypto.h>

 struct tm *OPENSSL_gmtime(const time_t *timer, struct tm *result);
 int OPENSSL_gmtime_adj(struct tm *tm, int offset_day, long offset_sec);
 int OPENSSL_gmtime_diff(int *pday, int *psec,
                        const struct tm *from, const struct tm *to);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OPENSSL_gmtime() returns the UTC time specified by B<timer> into the provided
B<result> argument.

OPENSSL_gmtime_adj() adds the offsets in B<offset_day> and B<offset_sec> to B<tm>.

OPENSSL_gmtime_diff() calculates the difference between B<from> and B<to>.

=head1 NOTES

It is an error to call OPENSSL_gmtime() with B<result> equal to NULL. The
contents of the time_t given by B<timer> are stored into the B<result>. Calling
with B<timer> equal to NULL means use the current time.

OPENSSL_gmtime_adj() converts B<tm> into a days and seconds value, adds the
offsets, then converts back into a B<struct tm> specified by B<tm>. Leap seconds
are not considered.

OPENSSL_gmtime_diff() calculates the difference between the two B<struct tm>
structures B<from> and B<to>. The difference in days is placed into B<pday>,
the remaining seconds are placed to B<psec>. The value in B<psec> will be less
than the number of seconds per day (3600). Leap seconds are not considered.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OPENSSL_gmtime() returns NULL on error, or B<result> on success.

OPENSSL_gmtime_adj() and OPENSSL_gmtime_diff() return 0 on error, and 1 on success.

=head1 HISTORY

OPENSSL_gmtime(), OPENSSL_gmtime_adj() and OPENSSL_gmtime_diff() have been
in OpenSSL since 1.0.0.
