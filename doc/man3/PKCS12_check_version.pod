=head1 NAME

PKCS12_check_version - Checks the version of a PKCS#12 structure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/pkcs12.h>

 int PKCS12_check_version(const PKCS12 *p12);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PKCS12_check_version() checks that the version info of a I<p12> PKCS#12 object
is correct.

=head1 NOTES

A PKCS12 object can be loaded using d2i_PKC12(), d2i_PKC12_bio() or
d2i_PKC12_fp(). The loaded object contains a version number which should be the
value 3 according to RFC 7292.
As this version number has never been checked previously during loading,
adding the check to these functions would potentially break existing
PKCS12 files. Instead of adding an _ex variant of all these functions, the
function PKCS12_check_version() has been added instead.
PKCS12_check_version() should be called after loading a PKCS12
object before calling either PKCS12_parse() or PKCS12_unpack_authsafes().

=head1 RETURN VALUES

PKCS12_check_version() returns 1 if the version info of a I<p12> object is
correct, otherwise it returns 0.
