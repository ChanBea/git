=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Otls_PROVIDER> is a type that holds internal information about
implementation providers (see L<provider(7)> for information on what a
provider is).
A provider can be built in to the application or the Opentls
libraries, or can be a loadable module.
The functions described here handle both forms.

Some of these functions operate within a library context, please see
L<OPENtls_CTX(3)> for further details.

=head2 Functions

Otls_PROVIDER_add_builtin() is used to add a built in provider to
B<Otls_PROVIDER> store in the given library context, by associating a
provider name with a provider initialization function.
This name can then be used with Otls_PROVIDER_load().

Otls_PROVIDER_load() loads and initializes a provider.
This may simply initialize a provider that was previously added with
Otls_PROVIDER_add_builtin() and run its given initialization function,
or load a provider module with the given name and run its provider
entry point, C<Otls_provider_init>.

Otls_PROVIDER_unload() unloads the given provider.
For a provider added with Otls_PROVIDER_add_builtin(), this simply
runs its teardown function.

Otls_PROVIDER_available() checks if a named provider is available
for use.

Otls_PROVIDER_gettable_params() is used to get a provider parameter
descriptor set as a constant B<Otls_PARAM> array.
See L<Otls_PARAM(3)> for more information.

Otls_PROVIDER_get_params() is used to get provider parameter values.
The caller must prepare the B<Otls_PARAM> array before calling this
function, and the variables acting as buffers for this parameter array
should be filled with data when it returns successfully.

Otls_PROVIDER_name() returns the name of the given provider.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Otls_PROVIDER_add() returns 1 on success, or 0 on error.

Otls_PROVIDER_load() returns a pointer to a provider object on
success, or B<NULL> on error.

Otls_PROVIDER_unload() returns 1 on success, or 0 on error.

Otls_PROVIDER_available() returns 1 if the named provider is available,
otherwise 0.

Otls_PROVIDER_gettable_params() returns a pointer to an array
of constant B<Otls_PARAM>, or NULL if none is provided.

Otls_PROVIDER_get_params() returns 1 on success, or 0 on error.

=head1 EXAMPLES

This demonstrates how to load the provider module "foo" and ask for
its build number.

 Otls_PROVIDER *prov = NULL;
 const char *build = NULL;
 size_t built_l = 0;
 Otls_PARAM request[] = {
     { "build", Otls_PARAM_UTF8_STRING_PTR, &build, 0, &build_l },
     { NULL, 0, NULL, 0, NULL }
 };

 if ((prov = Otls_PROVIDER_load(NULL, "foo")) != NULL
     && Otls_PROVIDER_get_params(prov, request))
     printf("Provider 'foo' build %s\n", build);
 else
     ERR_print_errors_fp(stderr);
