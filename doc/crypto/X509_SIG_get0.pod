=head1 NAME

X509_SIG_get0 - Get DigestInfo functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509.h>

 void X509_SIG_get0(X509_ALGOR **palg, ASN1_OCTET_STRING **pdigest,
                    X509_SIG *sig);
 void X509_SIG_get0_const(const X509_ALGOR **palg,
                          const ASN1_OCTET_STRING **pdigest,
                          const X509_SIG *sig);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

X509_SIG_get0() returns pointers to the algorithm identifier and digest
value in B<sig>. These values can then be examined or initialised.

X509_SIG_get0_const() is the same as X509_SIG_get0() except that it works with
a const B<sig> value. The returned values are also const and therefore can be
examined but not changed.

=head1 HISTORY

B<X509_SIG_get0_const> was added in OpenSSL version 1.1.0.
