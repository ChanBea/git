=head1 NAME

pkeyparam - public key algorithm parameter processing tool

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<openssl> B<pkeyparam>
[B<-in> I<filename>]
[B<-out> I<filename>]
[B<-text>]
[B<-noout>]
[B<-engine> I<id>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pkey> command processes public or private keys.
They can be converted between various forms and their components printed out.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-in> I<filename>

This specifies the input filename to read parameters from.
Standard input is the default.

=item B<-out> I<filename>

This specifies the output filename to write parameters to.
Standard output is the default.

=item B<-text>

Prints out the parameters in plain text in addition to the encoded version. 

=item B<-noout>

Do not output the encoded version of the parameters.

=item B<-engine> I<id>

Specifying an engine (by its unique I<id> string) will cause B<pkeyparam> to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine, thus initialising it if needed.
The engine will then be set as the default for all available algorithms.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLE

Print out text version of parameters:

 openssl pkeyparam -in param.pem -text

=head1 NOTES

There are no B<-inform> or B<-outform> options for this command because only PEM format is supported, as the key type is determined by the PEM headers.
