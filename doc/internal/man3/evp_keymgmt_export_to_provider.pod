=head1 NAME

evp_keymgmt_export_to_provider - key material exporter to providers for EVP

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include "internal/evp_int.h"

 void *evp_keymgmt_export_to_provider(EVP_PKEY *pk, EVP_KEYMGMT *keymgmt);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

evp_keymgmt_export_to_provider() exports the key material from the
given key I<pk> to a provider via a B<EVP_KEYMGMT> interface, if this
hasn't already been done.
It maintains a cache of provider key references in I<pk> to keep track
of all such exports.

If I<pk> has an assigned legacy key, a check is done to see if any of
its key material has changed since last export, i.e. the legacy key's
is_dirty() method returns 1.
If it has, the cache of already exported keys is cleared, and a new
export is made with the new key material.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

evp_keymgmt_export_to_provider() returns a pointer to the newly
created provider side key, or NULL on error.

=head1 NOTES

"Legacy key" is the term used for any key that has been assigned to an
B<EVP_PKEY> with EVP_PKEY_assign_RSA() and similar functions.
