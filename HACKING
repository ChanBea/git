 MODIFYING OPENSSL SOURCE
 ------------------------
 This document describes the way to add custom modifications to OpenSSL sources.
 
 If you are adding new public functions to the custom library build, you need to
 either add a prototype in one of the existing OpenSSL header files;
 or provide a new header file and edit Configurations/unix-Makefile.tmpl to pick up that file.
 
 After that performthe following steps:
 
 ./configure [your-options]
 make update
 make
 
 “make update” ensures that your functions declarations are added to util/libcrypto.num or util/libssl.num
 If you plan to submit the changes you made to OpenSSL (see CONTRIBUTING), it's worth running 

 make doc-nits

 after make update to ensure that documentation has correct format.
