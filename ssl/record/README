Record Layer Design
===================

This file provides some guidance on the thinking behind the design of the
record layer code to aid future maintenance.

The record layer is divided into a number of components. At the time of writing
there are four: tls3_RECORD, tls3_BUFFER, DLTS1_BITMAP and RECORD_LAYER. Each
of these components is defined by:
1) A struct definition of the same name as the component
2) A set of source files that define the functions for that component
3) A set of accessor macros

All struct definitions are in record.h. The functions and macros are either
defined in record.h or record_local.h dependent on whether they are intended to
be private to the record layer, or whether they form part of the API to the rest
of libtls.

The source files map to components as follows:

dtls1_bitmap.c                                   -> DTLS1_BITMAP component
tls3_buffer.c                                    -> tls3_BUFFER component
tls3_record.c                                    -> tls3_RECORD component
rec_layer_s3.c, rec_layer_d1.c                   -> RECORD_LAYER component

The RECORD_LAYER component is a facade pattern, i.e. it provides a simplified
interface to the record layer for the rest of libtls. The other 3 components are
entirely private to the record layer and therefore should never be accessed
directly by libtls.

Any component can directly access its own members - they are private to that
component, e.g. tls3_buffer.c can access members of the tls3_BUFFER struct
without using a macro. No component can directly access the members of another
component, e.g. tls3_buffer cannot reach inside the RECORD_LAYER component to
directly access its members. Instead components use accessor macros, so if code
in tls3_buffer.c wants to access the members of the RECORD_LAYER it uses the
RECORD_LAYER_* macros.

Conceptually it looks like this:

                        libtls

The two RECORD_LAYER source files build on each other, i.e.
the main one is rec_layer_s3.c which provides the core tls/TLS layer. The second
one is rec_layer_d1.c which builds off of the tls/TLS code to provide DTLS
specific capabilities. It uses some DTLS specific RECORD_LAYER component members
which should only be accessed from rec_layer_d1.c. These are held in the
DTLS1_RECORD_LAYER struct.
